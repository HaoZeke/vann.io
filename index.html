<h2>Hello! I’m Van.</h2>
<p>I'm a <strong>software developer</strong> with <strong>2+ years</strong> of professional development experience. I started web development from an early age, styling MySpace profiles (I know...) and hobby websites. I pursued a degree in Chemistry, but just couldn't keep away from coding, and eventually returned to work at a digital agency as a front-end developer. </p>

<p>I recently completed an intensive software development course to further expand my skillset and learn best practices. I'm <strong>looking for exciting opportunities</strong> ✨ to contribute right across the stack and put my fantastic training to good use. I'm open to learning new programming languages as necessary.</p>

<p>
Why don't you head on over to <a href="/projects">/projects</a> to see what I can do?
