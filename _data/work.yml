  summary: A custom clone of a Space Invaders game, as a light-hearted approach to climate change deniers
  role: Lead developer
  technologies: Pixi.js
  challenges: Interaction differences between mobile and desktop devices
  solution: For small screens, I decreased the number of 'invaders' (in comparison to the number on larger screens) whilst increasing the dimensions to improve visibility. I implemented additional on-screen controls for devices that lack keyboard support.

  summary: An animated scrolling site following the stories of four people struggling with hunger
  role: Lead developer
  technologies: ScrollMagic, GreenSock
  challenges: Handling the sheer number of animations, timing and layering of assets
  solution: I used a mixture of CSS <code>position</code> and <code>translate</code> to keep images hidden off-screen, until tweened into view. I divided GreenSock tweens into 'scenes' based on the storyboard provided, to keep the arrangement of animations managable.

  summary: A map-based story detailing the conflicts surrounding Syria within the last 5 years
  role: Lead developer (Introduction)
  technologies: ScrollMagic, GreenSock, Paper.js
  challenges: Creating an animated 'glitchy pixel' image overlay
  solution: I generated a grid of small squares in a canvas element, then used paper.js to determine the 'average colour' of the underlying image section behind each square. I cycled the coloured squares through random opacities at random intervals to create a pixelated flicker.
