        <title>Week 1</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;First week of Makers is officially done! I’ve been keeping some incoherent, but shortish thoughts for each day:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I’m in Maker’s biggest cohort, ever. That’s a lotta names and faces to remember.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/samm-dayone.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Makers Academy first day&quot; /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Sorry for the blurry photo &amp;mdash; Sam is very animated&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Had a few talks introducing ideologies like extreme programming, and generally what we’re expected to learn. Surprisingly, it’s not really about the code. They want us to walk away with, at the bare minimum, the right behaviours and attitudes as a developer. There was also emphasis on getting physical exercise to tire our bodies out, otherwise we may have difficulty getting a good amount of rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The day (dare I say?) could have been better planned and timed — only because we had an overly long lunch break and the day ended at half 4. I don’t mind &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; much at this point, but I didn’t pay thousands to sit around twiddling my thumbs. They took us to the pub afterwards though, so I can’t complain too much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tue&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I slept for THREE HOURS — I should have heeded their warning about lack of exercise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Got assigned Captain Code as my pair partner. Who is Captain Code? He is the lorem ipsum of people and only exists because there’s an odd number of students in the cohort. I ended up joining an existing pair and three-way-paired instead, creating a third role as the backseat-driver/passenger. We struggled with instance variables, something I didn’t think I would ever have trouble with. I like that I got stuck though, because it forced me to play with something I thought I knew, in a different context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also had a presentation about diversity (specifically women). Not trying to be dismissive, but it wasn’t anything I wasn’t already aware of. I once went to a JavaScript WebGL meetup — I was so excited to learn more about Three.js, but I was &lt;em&gt;one of two&lt;/em&gt; women, and felt blindingly aware that I couldn’t join the ‘lad banter’ around the pizza and beer table when I arrived. It’s unreal how the food and drink served, but mostly the brogrammer atmosphere it created, put me off ever returning to similar meetups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Had a workshop about classes! The main point of them is that they encapsulate behaviours. At my previous workplace, I attempted to keep my JavaScript similarly modular, but it’s so much nicer to do in Ruby. Ruby is the bomb. Workshops are equally awesome. They’re structured as a quick presentation and demonstration, followed by a paired 20-30min exercise, and then a group discussion for feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also feel like I’m getting better at pairing. I find I’m owning my decisions, becoming more assertive and sure of myself whilst navigating. This week’s aim is to practice more TDD (test-driven development). I’m having trouble getting into the habit of writing extensive tests before writing code though. It just feels a lot more natural to jump right into code when I know exactly what needs to be written.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thurs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I practiced my explanation skills quite a bit today. I just need to ensure I’m using the right terminology and not just pointing to code and referring to it as the ‘thing’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Had another workshop, this time about debugging code. The main takeaways are to ‘tighten the loop’, then ‘get visibility’. How I have tended to do it in JavaScript is to locate the line of the error from the console (tightening the loop), then using &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;console.log&lt;/code&gt; around the offending lines (getting visibility). It’s good to know I was on the right track and haven’t spent 2 years debugging like an idiot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tuesday and Thursday are yoga days, which I took part in today. I forgot my sun salutation routine but it didn’t seem to matter as the practice is very open and flexible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fri&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Today’s workshop was on doubles in RSpec, and deciding whether or not to mock behaviour using box and arrow diagrams. I am still confused and think I need to spend more time with Sandi Metz (or at least her POODR).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every Friday we also have a confidence workshop and a retrospective. These are to gauge how confident we feel with certain topics. In groups of four, we discuss and explain it to each other before submitting a survey on how we feel post-discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 5:30pm I had had enough, so played Cards Against Humanity and ping-pong to wind down the week.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Precourse week 4 &amp;mdash; POODR and chill</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The precourse is officially over! Week 4 work wasn’t nearly as intense, so I had time to start reading through the &lt;em&gt;Well Grounded Rubyist&lt;/em&gt; and flick through &lt;em&gt;POODR&lt;/em&gt; (Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby) — the two most recommended books for the course. I also picked up a dinky little O’Reilly Ruby pocket guide, because who has the shoulder strength to carry heavy books &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; their laptop everyday?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did my first proper pairing exercise earlier on in the week. Me and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/andreamazza89&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Andrea&lt;/a&gt; completed a couple of katas and the fizzbuzz challenge over Screenhero — a program that shares one screen with another user. One person ‘navigates’ (directs) whilst the other ‘drives’ (types) the code-writing. I actually really like paired-programming and wish it was a practice I had picked up earlier. Not only is it faster for solving problems, but staring at code all day can get lonely, so being able to ask silly questions to a real person &lt;em&gt;is just so nice&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Using tags in Jekyll</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Taking a sidestep from fizzbuzzing and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/vannio/fizzbuzz-1/blob/master/lib/fizzbuzz.rb#L24&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;playing with Giphy APIs&lt;/a&gt;, I thought I’d implement tag index pages properly on this blog (without any plugins). My Makers Academy related posts keep being muddied up with unrelated posts, and I needed a way to filter them out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re unfamiliar with Jekyll, it’s a static site generator. You can type up some basic &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.md&lt;/code&gt; files as blog posts and Jekyll generates the HTML for a fully functioning website. It has a templating engine built-in, which keeps the code DRY (don’t repeat yourself) by using templates that swap in variables and partials. It can even fill out templates with JSON/YAML data. I won’t go into detail about how to get started as it’s all in the documentation, although I did attempt to create a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/vannio/Jekyll-babel-starter&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;boilerplate of sorts&lt;/a&gt; that aims to take the difficulty out of Jekyll by letting Gulp.js automate a lot of stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst categories work fine, tags aren’t really ‘supported’ in Jekyll. The documentation tells you how to tag your posts, but then you’re left to scratch your head in confusion from that point onwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-yml&quot; data-lang=&quot;yml&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;---&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;layout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;post&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;Using tags in Jekyll&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;2016-05-19 10:00:00 +0100&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;categories&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;general&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# Here we go, tags!&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;tags&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;this is how&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;I do&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;---&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# The rest of blog post content goes down here&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s an example of the YAML Front Matter block for a blog post. The tags are &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;this is how&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;I do&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;it&lt;/code&gt;, just as expected. It’s a pain but you’ll need to manually create a page for every tag you have. For my tag &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;it&lt;/code&gt; (really useful name), I’d create an &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;it.html&lt;/code&gt; page with this snippet:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-yml&quot; data-lang=&quot;yml&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# Loop through all the posts tagged &#39;it&#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;for post in site.tags.it %&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# Print the title of each post&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;{{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;post.title&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;}}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# Loop through all the tags this post is tagged as&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# and print the name of each tag&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;for tag in post.tags %&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;tag&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;{{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;tag&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;}}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;endfor %&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;endfor %&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assuming I only have one sad post tagged &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;it&lt;/code&gt;, the html generated would be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot; data-lang=&quot;html&quot;&gt;title: Using tags in Jekyll
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;tag: this is how
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;tag: I do
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;tag: it&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s pretty much it! I’d then go ahead and fill out &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;it.html&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;post.content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; or link the title to the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;post.url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re still confused, have a look at &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/vannio/vann.io&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the repo for this blog&lt;/a&gt;. I always find that I need to be able to explore how something is structured before I really understand what’s going on.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Precourse week 3 &amp;mdash; Thanks for the memories</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s been difficult completing week 3 of the precourse in depth as there were a lot of fiddly and time-consuming exercises, yet so little time to do them all. I had to do most of the work at the weekend, but by then I was nursing one hell of a hangover from my leaving do, and every line of code was a blurry struggle to write.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We covered recursion and a bit of blocks/procs/yielding, but anything that requires putting one thing into another thing and then that thing into another thing, really baffles me. I just about managed to scrape a green tick on my submitted answers the night before the deadline, and only because I skimmed through the exercises that didn’t have any RSpec tests (&lt;em&gt;CHEAT!&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://vanvanvanvanvan.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/vanvanvanvanvan.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Smart mirror wide view&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://vanvanvanvanvan.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;vanvanvanvanvan.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve now officially left my job though (&lt;em&gt;sob&lt;/em&gt;). They built me this incredibly beautiful monstrosity so I don’t forget about them, and it’s working! However, my first day off has been &lt;em&gt;amazing&lt;/em&gt;. I… Queen Helene’d my face (that’s a face mask to the non-skincare addicts) whilst doing a few paired-programming katas over Screenhero, had a nap, made myself a fish finger sandwich, got a manicure, went shopping, then for a few rounds of badminton, a natter at the pub, and back in time for Game of Thrones. I feel so free!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My point is that I absolutely recommend keeping your schedule free during the precourse weeks. I know the guidelines are to spend about 15 hours a week on the content, which you can &lt;em&gt;technically&lt;/em&gt; fit around a 9-5 job, but it is really difficult to maintain a &lt;strong&gt;healthy&lt;/strong&gt; work-life balance. Ever heard of the cheap—fast—quality triangle? Generally speaking, client projects will fit two of those three requirements, whilst the third is sacrificed. For example, a project can be done cheaply and quickly, but will likely have awful quality spaghetti code. If you’re still at a full-time job, the precourse definitely feels like that, only it’s a work—life—study triangle. RIP lyf 😥&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Precourse week 2 &amp;mdash; The final countdown</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s my final week at Nice and Serious. I say that with a heavy heart, but also with excitement at what comes next. My swan song is a site for &lt;a href=&quot;http://goodbadpalmoil.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;RSPO’s campaign for good palm oil&lt;/a&gt; which fully launches today. If you’re a 30yr old woman in New York, watch out! Targeted ads are coming to get you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/rspo-palm-oil.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;RSPO - Good or bad palm oil&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The site uses the SVG.js library to dynamically create and tile squiggly sprinkles, so that they don’t overflow the containers, don’t overlap each other, don’t intercept the text (much) and scale reasonably on different screen sizes. It was so much work for such a seemingly small feature!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;😲 😞&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m still struggling to find the time to do any of the precourse work outside of my working hours, so in all honesty I am quite relieved to be leaving soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I managed to get a few more code katas (smallish exercises) completed over the weekend though. There were some that gave me typer’s block, so I ended up breaking the #1 Makers rule by fixating on them waaay longer than 30mins. I’m too fiercely stubborn to simply give up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I did this thing where I walked up on stage in front of thousands of people at the Royal Albert Hall, and then walked straight back off again. Somehow, that took up most of my day and now I am &lt;em&gt;exhausted&lt;/em&gt;. I got back and managed 1.5 Ruby challenges before I fell asleep again. Sometimes I just need to accept that my body needs to rest!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Precourse week 1 &amp;mdash; Not just &#39;how&#39;</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Initially, streams and pipes were just some magic terms that I thought were too hard for me to bother learning about, so I made an educated guess and continued to work on those assumptions for a long time. Now that I’ve actually taken the time to learn, it just seems so glaringly obvious (and in all fairness, pretty spot-on from what I had guessed). I’ve been writing gulpfiles and ‘piping streams’ for god knows how long, without being confident that I understood what I was doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of things I learnt how to do that have become second-nature, but I have rarely been able to describe &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; I do such things. That in itself is a lesson learnt: understand the ‘why’ as well as the ‘how’ because it provides so much clarity, and as a result, allows room for reflection and improvement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I finished the first week’s challenge rather belatedly this morning. It was as fun as I had imagined, and it was great to see that the guides were written with a sense of humour, like using a bank robbery scenario as an example of version control (e.g. messing up; needing to restore a previous commit → forgetting a balaclava during the robbery; needing to time-travel back to retry).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Embarrassingly, I’d never done a pull request up until now either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/pull-req.png&quot; alt=&quot;First pull request&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the teeny-tiniest adjustment (literally the removal of a single dash) but it took me what felt like half an hour just going back and forth to check it was correct before submitting. Now that I’m well past my first pull request hurdle and I’ve just about stopped my nervous shakes, I’m that little bit more confident to contribute to open-source projects. A very wise supermarket slogan once told me that every little helps 😊&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Precourse intro &amp;mdash; It begins!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday evening was the induction to the precourse at Makers Academy. During the part-time precourse, we’re expected to get to the same skill-level as each other before starting the full-time course, so that trivial things like basic syntax and environment setup don’t hold us back. I met some of the other students too, of course. They’re all super friendly and keen (I expected no less) with very varied backgrounds — one student sells maps, which I think is amazing because it’s so damn niche.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I finally had a chance to look at the materials after work today. Command line and version control is up first? Easy peasy, I use these all the time! But hold up — what does &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;touch&lt;/code&gt; do? What about &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;tail&lt;/code&gt;? And &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;cat&lt;/code&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot; data-instgrm-captioned=&quot;&quot; data-instgrm-version=&quot;6&quot; style=&quot; background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 2rem auto; max-width:400px; padding:0; width:99.375%;&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;padding:8px;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=&quot; background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:50.0% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=&quot; background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAAGFBMVEUiIiI9PT0eHh4gIB4hIBkcHBwcHBwcHBydr+JQAAAACHRSTlMABA4YHyQsM5jtaMwAAADfSURBVDjL7ZVBEgMhCAQBAf//42xcNbpAqakcM0ftUmFAAIBE81IqBJdS3lS6zs3bIpB9WED3YYXFPmHRfT8sgyrCP1x8uEUxLMzNWElFOYCV6mHWWwMzdPEKHlhLw7NWJqkHc4uIZphavDzA2JPzUDsBZziNae2S6owH8xPmX8G7zzgKEOPUoYHvGz1TBCxMkd3kwNVbU0gKHkx+iZILf77IofhrY1nYFnB/lQPb79drWOyJVa/DAvg9B/rLB4cC+Nqgdz/TvBbBnr6GBReqn/nRmDgaQEej7WhonozjF+Y2I/fZou/qAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p style=&quot; margin:8px 0 0 0; padding:0 4px;&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/BEPI6ivkkB7/&quot; style=&quot; color:#000; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none; word-wrap:break-word;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Cat coaster&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;&quot;&gt;A photo posted by Vannio (@vannio) on &lt;time style=&quot; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;&quot; datetime=&quot;2016-04-15T21:48:20+00:00&quot;&gt;Apr 15, 2016 at 2:48pm PDT&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; defer=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This cat is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; related to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;cat&lt;/code&gt;, unfortunately. &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;cat&lt;/code&gt; is actually short for concatenate. I learnt something new already, even as a &lt;em&gt;somewhat&lt;/em&gt; experienced developer, and I’ve only been looking at this stuff for an hour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I skipped ahead a little (oops) just to see the challenge I’m working towards this week — it’s some kind of murder mystery gamified task. Bring it on, I love a good puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Why Makers Academy?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I have a degree in Chemistry. After graduating and deciding the industry was not for me, I bounced around various comms-based jobs, unsure of what I really wanted. I ended up doing a masters in Science Communication, whilst working as a front-end web developer at a company who specialise in communicating scientific issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been happy for the past 2 years, because my hobby had become my job. But now I’m starting to realise that front-end alone isn’t enough; I want to do more than make static sites. I want to be a well-rounded full-stack developer — and fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/makers-intro.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Smart mirror wide view&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 350px&quot; /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Predicting my future&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After lots of umm-ing/ahh-ing, advice from mentors and excitable justification to anyone who would listen, I bit the bullet by leaving my job. Come May, I’ll be embarking on an intensive 12-week development course at Makers Academy to really give myself a solid foundation of knowledge. I have no idea what will happen once I’m finished — I’ll just have to tackle any challenges as they come!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>S.M.R.T. (the smart mirror)</title>
        <description>&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/smrt-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Smart mirror wide view&quot; class=&quot;xl&quot; /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Grab a brush and put a little makeup&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I moved out of my family home recently, but found that there was no dressing-table mirror in my new flat *gasp*. Since moving out, my time-keeping has also taken a nosedive and I’ve found myself constantly being late, so to make living independently smoother and to solve such problems in one fell swoop, I made a smart mirror!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mirror itself is a sheet of 2-way glass, custom cut to fit inside a cheap photo frame I got from Ikea. Unlike regular mirror glass it only reflects about 50% of light, but otherwise lets the rest through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/smrt-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Smart mirror set-up&quot; /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Monitor and Raspberry Pi setup behind the mirror&lt;br /&gt;(sorry for potato-quality)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An old monitor hooked up to a Raspberry Pi lives behind the glass, and a simple web-app is displayed in kiosk mode. Once the mirror is in place (aka haphazardly balanced on the monitor), anything that isn’t black shows through the glass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The web-app, which can be found &lt;a href=&quot;/graveyard/smrt&quot; target=&quot;\_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, is what makes the mirror ‘smart’ — it includes the date and time, travel updates (TfL) to speed up my mornings, and the weather forecast (MetOffice) so that I leave the flat in weather-appropriate clothes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/smrt-3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Smart mirror close-up view&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I ever get round to it, motion detection — to make the monitor switch itself on as someone walks by — would be a pretty awesome addition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update Jan 5&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; —&lt;br /&gt;I shared this on Reddit. I think people &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeupAddiction/comments/3zc5qh/i_built_a_smart_mirror_for_my_vanity/&quot; target=&quot;\_blank&quot;&gt;liked it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
