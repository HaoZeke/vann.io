  <h2 class="skills__title">I can offer &mdash;</h2>
  <h4>A curious mind ðŸ’­</h4>
  <p>I learn by throwing myself in the deep-end and using shiny new technology on real projects. I was incredibly interested in websockets, and successfully learnt how to use the technology by building a <a href="https://github.com/gtormiston/battlecodes" target="_blank">real-time multiplayer game</a>.</p>

  <h4>Busy hands ðŸ™Œ</h4>
  <p>I enjoy deconstructing and rebuilding things to understand how they work, much to my parents' dismay when I took my first computer apart. In an attempt to further understand how a popular framework like <em>Express</em> works, I built <a href="https://github.com/vannio/unicorn-framework" target="_blank">a web framework</a> from scratch, using only default Node packages for static file serving and HTTP requests. It even includes a custom-built template rendering engine!</p>

  <h4>Problem solving ðŸ’¡</h4>
  <p>My background in Chemistry comes into use surprisingly often. I've learnt to take a more scientific and systematic approach to solving a problem, starting off with a hypothesis and testing it out, either by writing unit tests or intentionally breaking code (and subsequently fixing it, of course). I'm no stranger to puzzles and can even navigate my way around a Rubik's cube.</p>

  <h4>Completion ðŸ’¯</h4>
  <p>Once I commit to something, I give it my all. As well as trying to finish every side quest in <em>Skyrim</em> and <em>Dragon Age</em>, I complete projects as thoroughly as I can down to every last detail. I enjoy seeing projects evolve from vague client requirements through to a polished piece <a href="http://www.cssdesignawards.com/sites/hunger-in-america/27931/" target="_blank">worthy of industry recognition</a>.</p>
