      <p>Itâ€™s been difficult completing week 3 of the precourse in depth as there were a lot of fiddly and time-consuming exercises, yet so little time to do them all. I had to do most of the work at the weekend, but by then I was nursing one hell of a hangover from my leaving do, and every line of code was a blurry struggle to write.</p>

<p>We covered recursion and a bit of blocks/procs/yielding, but anything that requires putting one thing into another thing and then that thing into another thing, really baffles me. I just about managed to scrape a green tick on my submitted answers the night before the deadline, and only because I skimmed through the exercises that didnâ€™t have any RSpec tests (<em>CHEAT!</em>).</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve now officially left my job though (<em>sob</em>). They built me this incredibly beautiful monstrosity so I donâ€™t forget about them, and itâ€™s working! However, my first day off has been <em>amazing</em>. Iâ€¦ Queen Heleneâ€™d my face (thatâ€™s a face mask to the non-skincare addicts) whilst doing a few paired-programming katas over Screenhero, had a nap, made myself a fish finger sandwich, got a manicure, went shopping, then for a few rounds of badminton, a natter at the pub, and back in time for Game of Thrones. I feel so free!</p>

<p>My point is that I absolutely recommend keeping your schedule free during the precourse weeks. I know the guidelines are to spend about 15 hours a week on the content, which you can <em>technically</em> fit around a 9-5 job, but it is really difficult to maintain a <strong>healthy</strong> work-life balance. Ever heard of the cheapâ€”fastâ€”quality triangle? Generally speaking, client projects will fit two of those three requirements, whilst the third is sacrificed. For example, a project can be done cheaply and quickly, but will likely have awful quality spaghetti code. If youâ€™re still at a full-time job, the precourse definitely feels like that, only itâ€™s a workâ€”lifeâ€”study triangle. RIP lyf ðŸ˜¥</p>

      <p>Itâ€™s my final week at Nice and Serious. I say that with a heavy heart, but also with excitement at what comes next. My swan song is a site for <a href="http://goodbadpalmoil.org" target="_blank">RSPOâ€™s campaign for good palm oil</a> which fully launches today. If youâ€™re a 30yr old woman in New York, watch out! Targeted ads are coming to get you.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/rspo-palm-oil.jpg" alt="RSPO - Good or bad palm oil" /></p>

<p>The site uses the SVG.js library to dynamically create and tile squiggly sprinkles, so that they donâ€™t overflow the containers, donâ€™t overlap each other, donâ€™t intercept the text (much) and scale reasonably on different screen sizes. It was so much work for such a seemingly small feature!</p>

<p>ðŸ˜² ðŸ˜ž</p>

<p>Iâ€™m still struggling to find the time to do any of the precourse work outside of my working hours, so in all honesty I am quite relieved to be leaving soon.</p>

<p>I managed to get a few more code katas (smallish exercises) completed over the weekend though. There were some that gave me typerâ€™s block, so I ended up breaking the #1 Makers rule by fixating on them waaay longer than 30mins. Iâ€™m too fiercely stubborn to simply give up.</p>
