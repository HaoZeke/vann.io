title:  How to AWS, Apache and virtual host

Since I nabbed free Amazon Web Services (AWS) credit from my student days, and since they offer a year's free access on top of that, I wanted to use it to set up an Apache (ah-patch-ee? appa-shay?) virtual host, which allows me to run multiple websites from one server. This blog now sits on said server, although only static sites can be hosted as I haven't installed any database stuff just yet &mdash; I'll cross that bridge when I need to.

I was completely baffled by the idea of virtual hosts way back when, but they make deploying and updating sites from git repos such a doddle (because shell access, duh) &mdash; and to think, I was dragging and dropping files using FTP on shared hosting *for years*.

The dashboard for AWS can be really, really daunting. What we're looking for is the EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) service.

<ol>
<li><p>On the EC2 dashboard, create a key pair and save the private <code>.pem</code> key somewhere recoverable on your computer. We'll use this later to stop unauthorised access from an imposter.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Launch a new EC2 instance from a Ubuntu 14.04 virtual machine image. There are two versions to pick from: HVM and PV. I'll admit that I have little knowledge of the difference, so I chose HVM since Amazon seem to be recommending it and because <a href="//highscalability.com/blog/2014/8/18/1-aerospike-server-x-1-amazon-ec2-instance-1-million-tps-for.html" target="\_blank">this guy</a> said so.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Choose the instance type &mdash; t2.micro is a good choice if you're not expecting a lot of traffic, and it's free! I like free. Use default settings for the config, storage and tag options, unless something compels you to choose otherwise.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Create a security group that allows incoming SSH access from your own IP address, and that allows HTTP and HTTPS access from anywhere. Then launch!
</p></li>

<li><p>
Optional: If you have a domain name you'd like to use, set up a CNAME or A record on your domain's control panel that points to the IP address of your new EC2 instance. This is the bit that can sometimes take a while to propagate, so do this as soon as you can.
</p></li>

<li><p>Now whip open terminal to SSH into your server, making sure to include the private key generated earlier &mdash; <code>ubuntu</code> is the default user. I kept it as is, because ain't nobody got time to be changing it.
{% highlight shell %}
ssh -i path-of-file.pem ubuntu@ec2-public-ip-address
{% endhighlight %}
</p></li>

<li><p>
Install the Apache web server using Ubuntu's package manager.
{% highlight shell %}
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install apache2
{% endhighlight %}
</p></li>

<li><p>
Once that's all done and dusted, sort out the directory structure &mdash; the default document root should be <code>/home/ubuntu/public</code>. Create an empty directory inside it (or <code>git clone</code> your content) using the desired url as the name, then create some dummy content.
{% highlight shell %}
sudo mkdir /home/ubuntu/public/testing.com
nano /home/ubuntu/public/testing.com/index.html
{% endhighlight %}
</p></li>

<li><p>
Managing the virtual host files is the fiddly bit. These specify the configuration of the virtual host, and Apache will use them to respond to domain requests.
</p><p>Apache already has a default virtual host file. Shamelessly copy this and edit it for each site you'd like to serve.
{% highlight shell %}
sudo cp /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf /etc/apache2/sites-available/testing.com.conf
sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/testing.com.conf
{% endhighlight %}

These directives need to be updated:
<ul>
<li><code>ServerName</code> &mdash; matches this virtual host to the domain, eg. testing.com</li>
<li><code>ServerAlias</code> &mdash; points additional domains (if you have any) to this virtual host as well, eg. testing.co.uk</li>
<li><code>DocumentRoot</code> &mdash; where the files live</li>
</ul>
</p></li>

<li><p>
Once the file is saved, the site needs to be enabled and the server needs to be reloaded.
{% highlight shell %}
sudo a2ensite /etc/apache2/sites-available/testing.com.conf
sudo service apache2 reload
{% endhighlight %}
</p></li>

<li><p>
Optional: Update the default virtual host file to handle errors somewhat. Open up the file editor:
{% highlight shell %}
sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf
{% endhighlight %}

Then add these lines somewhere reasonable in it, updating the error page path as necessary:
{% highlight apache %}
ErrorDocument 404 /path-of-error-page.html
ErrorDocument 500 /path-of-error-page.html
ErrorDocument 502 /path-of-error-page.html
ErrorDocument 503 /path-of-error-page.html
ErrorDocument 504 /path-of-error-page.html
{% endhighlight %}

You'll see that when this blog throws a server error (eg. 404) it points to <a href="/oops.html" target="\_blank">oops.html</a>, so that's that in action!
</p></li>
</ol>
