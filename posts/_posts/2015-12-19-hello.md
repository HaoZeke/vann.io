<em>I was wondering if after all these years<br>I should start a blog...</em> &#x1F3B6;

Last Wednesday marked the 4th session of the <a href="http://girlsintechuk.com/programmes/mentoring-programme/" target="\_blank">Girls in Tech</a> mentoring scheme. The scheme is essentially a monthly speed-dating session with respected, influential individuals (mainly women) in the tech industry. One of the mentors mentioned that keeping a blog immensely helped her and inspired me to do the same. For the first time in years, I also have the time to actually read for pleasure! I'm currently reading the classic 'Dracula' by Bram Stoker which &mdash; if you have read it, will understand &mdash; constantly reminds me of the importance of keeping journals.

So that brings us here, to this <a href="//jekyllrb.com/" target="\_blank">jekyll-based</a> blog. Hello. This will be my space to talk all things web development, and where you can follow my journey of learning/doing/building, should you choose to do so.
