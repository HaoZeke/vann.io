This week has been _on point_. We've moved from programs that only live on the command line to making web applications, hooray! It's unbelievably satisfying building something concrete to show to my non-coding friends, rather than some strange, abstract Ruby thing that requires decent knowledge of the command line and `irb`.

The weekend challenge was to create a fully test-driven, neatly encapsulated, object-orientated game of Rock, Paper, Scissors. Once I got the bare-bones functioning game with all the unit and feature tests down, I was in my element as a front-end developer, making it _look_ cool. I started off with an embarrassing storyboard drawing:

I wanted a short time-lapse animation of the hands gesturing for each move, so I roped in my boyfriend for a couple of hours to help me take and edit a bunch of photos.

The animations work by sliding a spritesheet, one frame at a time, through a narrow container &mdash; like a film reel projector.

I had a lot of fun with this challenge. It was pretty much complete by the end of Saturday, so I spent the evening tidying my code with G&Ts in hand. I had friends over, but they didn't seem to mind me working, luckily!

And <a href="http://rock-paper-sizzle.herokuapp.com" target="_blank">here</a> is the finished product. It's hosted on a free Heroku package, which means it takes a while to wake up if it hasn't been viewed for a while. Be patient!

As for the silly player 2 names... Well, what is code without a little bit of whimsy?
