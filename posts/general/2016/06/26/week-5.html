This week has been a revelation — I finally understand how to use prototypes and constructors to better structure my code. It’s been quite the challenge to unlearn what I thought I knew, but I’m a lot happier thinking about JavaScript in a more object-orientated way.</p><p>This has also been the graduation week for the seniors. They’ve been working hard to build and present their fully-functional apps. They all used entirely new technologies and frameworks that aren’t in the curriculum, so I’m amazed at how much new learning happened in so little time.</p><figure><img src="/assets/railsgirls-june16.jpg" alt="Rails Girls, June 2016"><figcaption>Who is that awkward smiley person on the far-right?</figcaption></figure><p>Instead of doing the weekend challenge, I spent my Saturday volunteer-coaching at Rails Girls, a 1.5 day workshop to get badass women coding and building their first web-app using Ruby on Rails (RoR). 200 coaches and coachees turned up!</p><p>This time last year, I attended Rails Girls as a student (I hadn’t touched Ruby <em>or</em> RoR before), and have since paid it forward by coaching at each subsequent event. I still haven’t had much experience with RoR, but my understanding of MVC patterns, Ruby and CSS was more than enough. I spent a bit too long celebrating with the seniors on Friday, so I was running on 3-4 hours of sleep. I still had a great time and really think I got my coachee excited about code.</p></div></article><div class="post-nav"><span class="post-nav__link">&#x2039; <a class="prev" href="/posts/general/2016/06/17/week-4.html">Week 4 — Chitter, not Twitter</a></span> <span class="post-nav__link next"><a href="/posts/general/2016/07/03/week-6.html">Week 6 — Project week 1.0</a> &#x203A;</span></div></div></div><footer class="site-footer" id="contact"><div class="wrapper"><p><a href="http://twitter.com/vannio" target="_blank">twitter</a> <a href="http://linkedin.com/in/vannio" target="_blank">linkedin</a> <a href="http://github.com/vannio" target="_blank">github</a></p></div></footer><script>(function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){
