    <p>Initially, streams and pipes were just some magic terms that I thought were too hard for me to bother learning about, so I made an educated guess and continued to work on those assumptions for a long time. Now that Iâ€™ve actually taken the time to learn, it just seems so glaringly obvious (and in all fairness, pretty spot-on from what I had guessed). Iâ€™ve been writing gulpfiles and â€˜piping streamsâ€™ for god knows how long, without being confident that I understood what I was doing.</p>

<p>There are a lot of things I learnt how to do that have become second-nature, but I have rarely been able to describe <em>why</em> I do such things. That in itself is a lesson learnt: understand the â€˜whyâ€™ as well as the â€˜howâ€™ because it provides so much clarity, and as a result, allows room for reflection and improvement.</p>

<p>I finished the first weekâ€™s challenge rather belatedly this morning. It was as fun as I had imagined, and it was great to see that the guides were written with a sense of humour, like using a bank robbery scenario as an example of version control (e.g. messing up; needing to restore a previous commit â†’ forgetting a balaclava during the robbery; needing to time-travel back to retry).</p>

<p>Embarrassingly, Iâ€™d never done a pull request up until now either.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/pull-req.png" alt="First pull request" /></p>

<p>This was the teeny-tiniest adjustment (literally the removal of a single dash) but it took me what felt like half an hour just going back and forth to check it was correct before submitting. Now that Iâ€™m well past my first pull request hurdle and Iâ€™ve just about stopped my nervous shakes, Iâ€™m that little bit more confident to contribute to open-source projects. A very wise supermarket slogan once told me that every little helps ðŸ˜Š</p>
